# CORE PRINCIPLES [HIGHEST PRIORITY]

- ✅ DO: Follow exactly what is asked for and no more - suggesting improvements is encouraged, but implementing them without asking is not acceptable
- ✅ DO: Prioritize clear, straightforward solutions (Simplicity First)
- ✅ DO: Follow standards unless simplicity dictates otherwise
- ✅ DO: Ask explicitly whether backward compatibility is required during refactors - don't assume it is unless specified
- ❌ DON'T: Add optimization or abstraction without demonstrated need
