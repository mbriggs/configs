I'll help you understand the current state and plan this session's work.

## Load Context

- Read relevant CLAUDE.md files
- Read current/INTENT.md - problem and context
- Read current/APPROACH.md - technical strategy
- Read current/STEPS.md - progress and implementation notes
- Read any commits that may exist on the current branch

## Workflows

- Either we are working in a team context, in which case there is a ticket already broken down, and INTENT.md should be enough
- OR we are working independently, and we have an APPROACH with STEPS since we're working through a much larger chunk.

## Current State Assessment

EITHER:

- First unchecked step in STEPS.md
  OR:
- How far along we are against INTENT based on git commits and worktree state
-

## Session Planning

Break down work in the current step or overall INTENT into incremental steps.

Consider:

- Can we complete the full step or part of it?
- What's the logical order?
- Where are validation points?
- Where should we commit?

Scale the tasks based on risk:

- Simple: Larger tasks, fewer commits
- Complex: Smaller tasks, more validation, frequent commits

The session should end with updated STEPS.md capturing what we learned and what we committed (if it exists).
