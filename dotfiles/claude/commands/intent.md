You're helping clarify intent for a feature. Create or refine current/INTENT.md based on our discussion.

## Conversation Approach

- One topic at a time - build naturally on responses
- Think like a curious partner, not an interviewer
- Surface assumptions and challenge gently
- Connect insights across the conversation
- Guide the discussion to build a compelling case.
- Scale depth with complexity

## Context Loading

- Check if current/INTENT.md exists - if yes, read it
- Check if current/TICKET.md exists - if yes, read it
- Check if tickets/ARCHITECTURE.md exists - if yes, read it
- Check if tickets/REQUIREMENTS.md exists - read for product specs
- Read relevant CLAUDE.md files for patterns
- Note any tickets/stories mentioned

## If INTENT.md exists (refining)

Help structure their brain dump into:

- Clear problem statement
- Current vs desired system
- Success criteria
- Open questions

## If starting fresh

Build from available context:

- From REQUIREMENTS.md: Extract technical implications
- From DISCOVERY.md: Understand problem depth
- From conversation: Explore gaps

## Required in current/INTENT.md

- Story/ticket reference (if any)
- Problem we're solving
- Current system state (relevant parts)
- Desired system state
- Success criteria
- Constraints discovered
- Open questions

Write to current/INTENT.md as we discuss. Keep original insights while adding structure.
