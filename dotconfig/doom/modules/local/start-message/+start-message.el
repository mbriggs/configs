     "In programming, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. - Paul Graham"
     "If we want users to like our software we should design it to behave like a likeable person: respectful, generous and helpful. - Alan Cooper"
     "The lurking suspicion that something could be simplified is the world's richest source of rewarding challenges. - Edsger Dijkstra"
     "The computing scientist's main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making. - E. W. Dijkstra"
     "Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible. - Alan Kay"
     "Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated. - E.W. Dijkstra"

     "Administrative systems can sometimes define problem world states in terms of the computer state; cyber-physical systems must be more honest. - Alan Perlis"
     "You can't determine what went wrong unless you understand exactly what going right would have been. - Alan Perlis"
     "We lack suitable formalisations for causality, but the physical world doesn't know that. - Alan Perlis"
