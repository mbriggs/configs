Transform discovery findings into requirements. Create current/REQUIREMENTS.md.

## Context
Read current/DISCOVERY.md (fail if missing - requirements need discovery)

## Requirements Gathering
Ask about:
1. Core problem and affected users (if not clear from discovery)
2. How we'll measure success
3. Essential functionality vs nice-to-haves
4. Technical constraints or dependencies
5. Timeline pressures

Push for specifics. "Users want better search" â†’ "Users need to find products by SKU within 2 seconds"

## Output Structure
Create REQUIREMENTS.md with:
- Problem statement (1 paragraph)
- Success metrics (measurable)
- Core requirements (prioritized)
- Explicit non-requirements
- Key risks
- Open questions

Format based on what makes sense for the feature. Don't force user stories if they don't fit.
