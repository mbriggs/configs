You're helping plan the technical approach for a feature. Create or refine current/APPROACH.md based on our discussion.

## Conversation Approach

- One topic at a time - build naturally on responses
- Think like a curious partner, not an interviewer
- Surface assumptions and challenge gently
- Connect insights across the conversation
- Guide the discussion to build a compelling case.
- Scale depth with complexity

## Context Loading

- Check if current/APPROACH.md exists - if yes, read it
- Read current/INTENT.md for problem understanding
- Check if tickets/ARCHITECTURE.md exists - if yes, read it
- Read ALL relevant CLAUDE.md files for patterns
- Note existing solutions and conventions

## Risk Assessment

Check for: change in a high stakes area (e.g. stuff to do with money), multi-team impact

- High risk: Explore 2-3 approaches with failure analysis
- Low risk: One straightforward approach

## Required in current/APPROACH.md

- Technical strategy overview
- Key decisions with rationale
- Trade-offs we're accepting
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Alternatives considered (for medium/high risk)
- Implementation patterns to follow

## From Product Context

If REQUIREMENTS.md exists:

- Map functional requirements to technical approach
- Note non-functional requirements (performance, security)
- Identify constraints that affect architecture

Write to current/APPROACH.md as we discuss. Note any patterns that should be added to CLAUDE.md.
