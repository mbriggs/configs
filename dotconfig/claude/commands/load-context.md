I'll help you understand the current state and plan this session's work.

## Load Context
- Read relevant CLAUDE.md files for patterns
- Read current/INTENT.md for the goal
- Read current/APPROACH.md if exists (strategy + implementation notes)
- If APPROACH.md exists, find next unchecked step and read that step file
- Run `git status` and `git log -3 --oneline` to see current state

## Session Planning
Based on current state:
1. What's today's step (from APPROACH.md progress) or overall goal (from INTENT.md)?
2. What specific tasks from the step file?
3. Any implementation notes from previous sessions?

## Validation Checks
- Is work still aligned with INTENT?
- Any blockers discovered in implementation notes?
- Does approach still make sense?

Output:
- Today's focus (specific step or single-session work)
- Concrete tasks to complete
- Definition of "done" for this session

After work, update step file with commits and APPROACH.md with learnings (if they exist).
