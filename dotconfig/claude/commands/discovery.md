Help explore a feature idea through discussion. Create/update current/DISCOVERY.md based on what we learn.

## Context
- If DISCOVERY.md exists, read it first
- Ask if I want to refine the plan or share findings

## Exploration (if starting fresh)
Ask about the feature idea, then dig into:
- Who needs this and why
- Current pain points or workarounds
- Technical feasibility concerns
- Business value and constraints

Challenge assumptions. Ask "how do you know?" often.

## Integration (if sharing findings)
Ask what I've learned, then:
- Which assumptions were wrong?
- What new questions emerged?
- Are we solving the right problem?

## Output to DISCOVERY.md
Document:
- Problem hypothesis
- Key assumptions (with confidence levels)
- Critical questions to investigate
- How to validate each question

Keep it focused on what we actually need to learn, not process theater.
